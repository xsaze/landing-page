        <div class="motivational-text">Boldly go in the direction of your dreams.

            Stand tall and show the world what you are made of. When the world beats you down, find a reason to get back up again. Never give up on the success.
            Try, try, try and try again. Feed your mind ideas of success, not failure.
            
            Remember, the only way you can fail is if you give up. Every time you fail, you come one step closer to success.
            
            You are not scared; you are courageous. You are not weak; you are powerful. You are not ordinary; you are remarkable.
            
            Do not back down, do not give up.
            
            When you look back on your life, don't have regrets. Believe in yourself, belief in your future, you will find your way.
            
            A fire burning inside you is mighty; it is waiting to burn bright. You are meant to do great things.
            
            Following your dreams can be both terrifying and exciting. 
            
            Courage is facing fear. Fear of failure holds most people back. You are not most people. 
            
            Persist and persuade others about your plans, as they are real. Nobody can do this but you. Nobody will get in the way of our dreams.
            
            Most people master the obvious; you create something that wasn't there before. It's bold, it's beautiful, and it's you.
            
            Give it your best, and your dreams will come to life. Success is yours.
            
            Go for your dreams; it is your turn.</div>
